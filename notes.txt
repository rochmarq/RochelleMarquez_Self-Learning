the outcome:
- two working buttons (work and break), one adds time to the clock, one resets the clock
- available as a desktop app (electron)

to do:
- make the start button for the timer functional
- make the break button for the timer functional
- style the timer app itself (maybe using figma or just find icons online)
- have the app work using electron (currently running through the browser app while im working on it)

possible additions:
- make the time for the app customizable (rather than just a set 25min work period and 5 min break period)

problems i came across:
- i forgot to initiate npm before installing react lol
- forgot to save electron.js before running to test the app (bruh)
- misspelled Window lol
-
