the outcome:
- two working buttons (work and break), one adds time to the clock, one resets the clock
- available as a desktop app (electron)

to do:
- make the start button for the timer functional
- make the break button for the timer functional
- style the timer app itself (maybe using figma or just find icons online) (or maybe do some pixel art again if i have time)
- have the app work using electron (currently running through the browser app while im working on it)

possible additions:
- make the time for the app customizable (rather than just a set 25min work period and 5 min break period)
- find a tut that shows how to have editable fields, ideally only lets you input numbers
- if i cant find that then adding a progress bar will do
- change styling of the app from the one i got from the tutorial
    - have the start/pause button switch between the two even if they're images (it will not be heard inshallah)

problems i came across:
- i forgot to initiate npm before installing react lol
- forgot to save electron.js before running to test the app (bruh)
- misspelled Window lol
- i dont understand progress bars
- the progress abr was stuck at full and didnt go down when the timer was going
    - had to change the progress width to be a percentage rather than a flat number
    - also had to updae how the progressed time was being read in its useEffect
- the progress bar was jumping to ~75% complete even though 1s just passed
    - had to fix the progress bar in the switchMode section because it wasnt updating the totalTime properly
- the start image isnt showing up as an image (i think its because its inside an if else statement)
    NEVERMIND IM A GENIUS HAHAHAHAH
- the app is not loading when using electron (doesnt even work with the tutorial timer when i downloaded the file and ran it.. strange)
    - only appears as a blank/white app but it's sized correctly to the dimensions given in the electron.js file
    - the error i get:

(node:31880) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: mainWindow.setWindowButtonVisibility is not a function

ME WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS I DIDNT CAPITALIZE URL IN THE LOADURL FUNCTION LOOOOOL

- close button doesnt work in electron app
    - me when i miss parentheses :skull:


- have progress bar be able to start and reset when start button is clicked
- possibly change start button to pause when clicked and add a reset button maybe (YERRRR)
- progress bar has to last the same length (time-wise) as timer (use the timeLeft function)
- progress bar has to pause when the pause button is clicked
